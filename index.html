          <h3>Web designing, web development and coding</h3>
          <h4>
            <p>Coding is a skill that I never imagined that I would accomplish. My family couldn’t afford a computer until I was about the age of 10.
              Learning how to use a computer wasn’t that difficult, and I was always afraid to try and code. However, with the help of the web development course by Angela Yu, I learned just how simple and fun coding can be, and my passion for
              computers grew once again.
              I am interested in designing and creating web pages for companies and can’t wait to experiment with new codes to discover what else I can create.</p>

          <h3>Helicopter mechanic</h3>
          <h4>
            <p class="P-2">Much as with the coding story, I never held a tool to fix any mechanical equipment, and the only thing I knew how to fix in a vehicle was the tire.
              Nevertheless, thanks to the education and training in the Marine Corps, I was able to learn how to troubleshoot fundamental mechanical problems, brainstorm on how to fix metal and composite bodywork, and figure out how to work with
              limited or no tools available for the work.
              The military also improved my communication and writing skills, problem-solving skills, and many other skills that will not fit in summary.</p>
